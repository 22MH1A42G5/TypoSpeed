## Prerequisites & Dependencies

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js:** (version 16 or higher recommended)
*   **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **yarn**
*   **Git:** For version control

## Installation & Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd TypoSpeed
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Firebase:**

    *   Create a new project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   Enable Authentication (e.g., Email/Password).
    *   Create a Realtime Database or Firestore Database to store user data.
    *   Copy the Firebase configuration object (API key, auth domain, etc.).

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

    *   Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory (if you aren't already using it as environment variables on your deployment platform).
    *   Add your Firebase configuration details:

        ```
        VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
        VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=<your_auth_domain>
        VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=<your_database_url>
        VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=<your_project_id>
        VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=<your_storage_bucket>
        VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=<your_messaging_sender_id>
        VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=<your_app_id>
        ```

5.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev  # or yarn dev
    ```

    The application should now be running at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Usage Examples & API Documentation

### Example - Basic Typing Test:

The main `App.jsx` component handles the rendering of the typing test interface.  The `Credentials.jsx` component handles login and registration functionality. The `ContactUs.jsx` component handles how a user can reach the development team for assistance.

### API Documentation:

The application utilizes Firebase for authentication and data storage. Refer to the [Firebase Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs) for detailed information on using the Firebase APIs.

## Configuration Options

You can customize the application by modifying the following:

*   **Firebase Configuration:** Adjust the Firebase configuration in the `.env` file to connect to your Firebase project.
*   **Styling:** Modify the `tailwind.config.js` file to customize the application's theme.
*   **Typing Test Content:**  The text used in the typing tests can be modified within the appropriate React components (e.g., `src/App.jsx`).
